# _Why a LEGO Simulation?_


-
# Relation to Agile
* Opens backlogs that trigger ideating rather than detailed instructions to follow.
* Promotes mindful product development rather than a series of tasks to accomplish.
* Establishes useful metrics to assess benefits of agile rather than figures the trainers asked to collect.
* Demonstrates continuous improvements rather than winning or losing the game with one try.
* Ensures teams collaborate toward common success rather than competition for score.


-
# User stories
* A user story is a description of a product feature from an end-user perspective.
* The user story describes the type of user, what they want, and why.
* Helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.
* Usually expressed using verbiage like
	* As a `specific-role` I would like to `perform-ability` to `facilitate need`.
	* As an `instructor` I would like to use `a whiteboard` to `express abstractions to students`.


-
# Backlogs
* Set of user stories that need have not been fulfilled by nor assigned to the current sprint
* list of prioritized features, containing short descriptions of all functionality desired in the product
* Should trigger ideating
* Description should be alterable upon further discussion


-
# Backlogs
* typically comprises
	* features
	* bugs
	* technical work
	* knowledge acquisition
* [source](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/scrum-tools/product-backlog)


-
# Example Backlog
* The following slide is an example of a backlog



-
# Lego City Backlog
### Transit
* As a lego person, I would like to live in an isolated forested area.
* As a lego person, I would I like to be within walking distance to a bus stop.

### Entertainment
* As a lego person, I would like to be within 20 minute bus-range of a train station
* As a lego person, I would like to be within 20 minute bus-range of a classical art gallery



-
# Product Development
* As a developer, the objective is to have clear vision of the requested end product
* Aggregation of backlogs should illustrate the requested end product


-
# Inter Team Collaboration
* Not a competition
* Work toward a common goal

-
# Production Metrics
* Establish convention for measuring productivity.
* `Velocity` is a measure of the amount of work a team can tackle during a single sprint.
	* is the key metric in Scrum.
	* is calculated at the end of the sprint by totaling the points for all fully completed User Stories.


-
# Continuous Improvements
* Sprints should yield progressively more productive results
* With each Sprint, a team further establishes a `velocity` which allows them to better estimate and execute their commitments.

#_Project Chartering_

-
#Keep In Mind
* Teams are not competing; collaborating
* product is a city
* building elements are Legos
* product owner is the maker of the product
* product owners will be available to dev for questions


-
# Sample City Features
* _dependent on product owner_
	* one story building (at least 2)
	* two story building (at least 1)
	* shop
	* school
	* hospital
	* kindergarten
	* bus stop
	* park
