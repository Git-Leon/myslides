#Breaking into tech




-
-
## Consider asking yourself the following

-
### Where are you in your career?
* I'm just starting out and I'm trying to figure out what I want.
* I've been in my career for 5-10+ years and I want to make a change
* I've taken a break from my career but I want to get back into the workforce


-
#### I'm just starting out
* tech is on the rise
  * jobs will continue to be automated and made obsolete
  * society is on track to building a lifestyle increasingly dependent on tech
* many companies offer sign-on bonuses and tech-skill up programs
* "In the future, we will teach programming like reading and writing and wonder why didn't do it sooner"
  * Mark Zuckerberg

-
#### I've been in my career awhile
* "I transitioned to the tech side of marketing by intentionally positioning myself in roles that would move me toward working with websites,"
  * Alexander Wise, Digital Media Analyst at seoWorks; former public relations agent
* "If you have strong skills in an existing industry, you can transition into a more technical position by moving into a crossover position"
  * Josh Lindenmuth, CIO at Payce Inc


-
#### I've taken a career-break
* This may be the sector with the greatest job opportunities to start a new career in
* Employers need technologists so badly, that the employment process has become very experimental in recent years
  * Employing from programming bootcamps
  * Employing persons with partial computer-science accreditation (regardless of not achieving degree)
  * Employing persons with _demonstrable_ skill-set necessary for role (regardless of background)
  * Employing persons who does not meet requirements of company

### If you could, how would you change your current career?
* More money!
* I'd like to be able to work from home (or remote, from anywhere in the world).
* I want to be my own boss, set my own schedule and choose my own work.
* Job security



-

#### I'd like to work from home

* In 2016, 57% of employees working in computer/information systems spent some of their time working remotely
  * `gallup.com`

-
#### I want to be my own boss
* Because of modern technology, freelance work has become very accessible to developers and technologists
  * `freelancer.com` is a site seeking freelance programmers to complete projects for $10 to $50,000+.

-
#### I want job security
* Tech industry, arguable, has greatest job security
* In the future, tech skills will become as imperative to a job as reading and writing
  * Cashiers must know how to operate a touch-screen interface
  * Dentists must know how to operate X-Ray scanners
  * Sonography is an entire industry based on a sonograph
  * Landlords have began using apartment-rental apps to allow tenants to pay rent

### What's your biggest concern about learning tech skills?
* I'm not smart enough to learn tech!
* I don't have time to learn new skills
* Learning to code is too expensive, I'm not sure it's worth it
* Inflexible life schedule




-
#### I'm not smart enough to learn tech
* We often mistake being _technical_ for being _intelligent_.
* Being effectively communicative is one of the most critical aspects of learning technology.
  * Often, highly _technical_ people lack the emotional _intelligence_ to effectively communicate to a general audience
    * establishing business requirements becomes very difficult
* "We've got a massive skills gap across the tech industry, so people with non-traditional backgrounds are becoming really valuable"
  * Kelli Jordan, talent leader at IBM



-
#### I don't have the Time
* Spending a little time each day to build on your skills will go a long way
* Tech skills are so valuable that even with minimal experience, entry positions will become available.
* As long as you are better today, than you were yesterday, you are moving in the right direction
  * Tariq Hook, former ZipcodeWilmington Head of Education


-
#### Learning Code is too Expensive
* The beauty of learning to code is that _nearly all_ introductory tech tools are free.
* Resetting a project is as simple as typing a command.
* This differs from other industries where physical infrastructure must be undone to resolve issues
  * Electrical engineers must purchase new motherboards if a chip is fried
  * Mechanical engineers must purchase new parts if a socket's threading is stripped
  * Software engineers create a new instance of a project or copy and paste old code to recover previous versioning





-
### I don't think tech has a presence in industry I'm interested in
* Tech is an omnipresent sector
* Even dry erase markers are manufactured using automated processes
  * Automotive industry has seen evidence of how automated processes can flip an industry on its head.
* Sonographers, dentists, landlords, and even cashiers are becoming dependent on tech to keep up with the changing scene



-
### Inflexible life schedule
* "A third of financial service employees report giving up work-life balance. A fourth said flexibility"
  * `cnbc.com` - Why people are choosing tech-work over finance-work










-
-
### What is the picture perfect workplace?
* A collaborative environment where I'm a full time member of a team
* Work at home in the morning, with time for kids' soccer practice in the afternoon
* A video conference with coworkers on my screen... and the beach behind it


-
#### Collaborative environment
* Resolving technical issues requires technical help
* No one person can resolve, or even be aware of, all problems in tech
* This creates very collaborative environments in the tech sector
* "If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room"
  * Mark Cuban




-
#### Work in morning, kids in afternoon
* Because of the advancements in telecommunications, employers of technologists allow employees to work very flexibly
* Tech-employers are very well known for creating workplace-accomadations due to a particular lifestyle (parent, adjunct, etc.)
  * Many tech companies have wellness and recreational centers on-site.

* Tech-employees are valuable and employers are aware that a single well-skilled employee can account for the jobs of tens, hundreds, and even thousands of employees.


-
#### Video Conference with Coworkers
* Part of the telecommunication advancements in recent history
* Remote video conference is becoming increasingly common
