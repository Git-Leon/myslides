#Breaking into tech




-
-
## Consider asking yourself

-
### Where are you in your career?
* I'm just starting out and I'm trying to figure out what I want.
* I've been in my career for 5-10+ years and I want to make a change
* I've taken a break from my career but I want to get back into the workforce


-
#### I'm just starting out
* tech is on the rise
  * jobs will continue to be automated and made obsolete
  * society is on track to building a lifestyle increasingly dependent on tech
* many companies offer sign-on bonuses and tech-skill up programs
* "In the future, we will teach programming like reading and writing and wonder why didn't do it sooner"
  * Mark Zuckerberg

-
#### I've been in my career awhile
* "I transitioned to the tech side of marketing by intentionally positioning myself in roles that would move me toward working with websites,"
  * Alexander Wise, Digital Media Analyst at seoWorks; former public relations agent
* "If you have strong skills in an existing industry, you can transition into a more technical position by moving into a crossover position"
  * Josh Lindenmuth, CIO at Payce Inc


-
#### I've taken a career-break
* Welcome back to the job hunt












-
-
### If you could, how would you change your current career?
* More money!
* I'd like to be able to work from home (or remote, from anywhere in the world).
* I want to be my own boss, set my own schedule and choose my own work.
* Job security



-
#### More money
* Tech is one of the highest paying industries

-
#### I'd like to work from home
* The rising popularity of remote work and companies seeking out remote employees comes as no surprise as new, innovative technology makes telecommuting and virtual collaboration easier and more effective than ever before.
* In 2016, 57% of employees working in computer/information systems spent some of their time working remotely
  * `gallup.com`

-
#### I want to be my own boss
* Because of modern technology, freelance work has become very accessible to developers and technologists
  * `freelancer.com` offers freelance positions paying between $20/hr to $250/hr

-
#### I want job security
* Tech industry, arguable, has greatest job security
* In the future, tech skills will become as imperative to a job as reading and writing
  * Cashiers must know how to operate a touch-screen interface
  * Dentists must know how to operate X-Ray scanners
  * Sonography is an entire industry based on a sonograph
  * Landlords have began using apartment-rental apps to allow tenants to pay rent

### What's your biggest concern about learning tech skills?
* I'm not smart enough to learn tech!
* It's too late in my career/life to make this big of a change
* I don't have time to learn new skills
* Learning to code is too expensive, I'm not sure it's worth it




-
#### I'm not smart enough to learn tech
* We often mistake being _technical_ for being _intelligent_.
* Being effectively communicative is one of the most critical aspects of learning technology.
  * Often, highly _technical_ people lack the emotional _intelligence_ to effectively communicate to a general audience
    * establishing business requirements becomes very difficult
* "We've got a massive skills gap across the tech industry, so people with non-traditional backgrounds are becoming really valuable"
  * Kelli Jordan, talent leader at IBM



-
#### It's too late in my career
* Naw, it's not.

-
#### I don't have the Time
* Spending a little time each day to build on your skills will go a long way
* Tech skills are so valuable that even with minimal experience, entry positions will become available.
* As long as you are better today, than you were yesterday, you are moving in the right direction
  * Tariq Hook, former ZipcodeWilmington Head of Education


-
#### Learning Code is too Expensive
* The beauty of learning to code is that nearly all introductory tech tools are free.
* Resetting a project is as simple as typing a command.
* This differs from other industries where physical infrastructure must be undone to resolve issues
  * Electrical engineers must purchase new motherboards if a chip is fried
  * Mechanical engineers must purchase new parts if a socket's threading is stripped
  * Software engineers create a new instance of a project or copy and paste old code to recover previous versioning





-
-
### I don't think tech has a presence in industry I'm interested in
* Yes, it does.






-
-
### What is the picture perfect workplace?
* A collaborative environment where I'm a full time member of a team
* Work at home in the morning, with time for kids' soccer practice in the afternoon
* A video conference with coworkers on my screen... and the beach behind it


-
#### Collaborative environment
* Yeah, tech has that



-
#### Work in morning, kids in afternoon
* Yeah, tech has that


-
#### Video Conference with Coworkers
* Yeah, tech has that

# You're right for tech if
* The smartest person in the room.
